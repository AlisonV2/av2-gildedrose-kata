# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

Bordeaux Ynov M1 - Architecture Logicielle

Kata: [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

# Steps

## Step 1: Setup

### Modifications 

I modified the original ES5 syntax to use ES6.
To do so, I installed and configured Babel.

### Workflow

Added Github Action workflow to open PR on dev branch push.

### Sanity test

Wrote and ran a sanity test to make sure Jest is working properly.

## Step 2: Write tests for the requirements

Requirements: [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.txt)

### Text-based test

The goal is to capture the existing output of the code and use it to check against everytime we make a change.
